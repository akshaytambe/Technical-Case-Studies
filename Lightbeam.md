# About the case study
Lightbeam is a Firefox plug-in extension which gives a graphical representation of the first and third-party site relationship that are active
on those pages. Lightbeam provides the in-depth visualization of tracking, including parts that remain unseen by an average user (i.e.,
trackers on the internet). Tracking, regarding web technology, can be defined as leaving a record (i.e., some amount of user data) while
you browse over the internet. This information can be processed to form a profile of the user by understanding the behavior of websurfing.
Corporations with advertising websites use this information to post relevant advertisements as per the user’s interest.

# How Lightbeam works
With Lightbeam Add-on enabled when we visit some website (often referred as First Party), the plug-in creates a real-time graphical
visualization of the all the third-party sites that are active on that page. The first party site is loading third party sites and not the user. The
Lightbeam also highlights the same third parties which are active on another website we visit. The Graphical View grows with every
website we visit and every request made from the browser. In addition to Graphical View, Lightbeam also provides a List View for indepth
analysis of individual sites.
